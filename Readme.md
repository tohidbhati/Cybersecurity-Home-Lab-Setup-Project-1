🔐 Cybersecurity Home Lab – Multi-OS Environment
📌 Overview

This project documents the setup of a personal cybersecurity home lab designed to simulate real-world attack and defense scenarios using multiple Windows environments and an attacker machine.

The lab was built using virtualization and isolated networking to safely practice penetration testing techniques.
